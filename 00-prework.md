# The Iron Yard Front End Engineering Prework

## Introduction
There are quite a few tasks and learning topics that are necessary to take care of before we can actually start learning how to be front end developers. Rather than using class time to get through these, I expect that you can accomplish and learn these things without assistance so that we can spend class time only on those things that are difficult to learn on your own. That being said, feel free to email me if you have any questions.

I don’t believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn’t be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and this work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

This work should be completed by February 1st and any deliverables should be emailed to me by then. I will assume that you have completed this work before class, so you will likely feel very far behind if you haven’t finished when we start class on February 1st.

In order to complete some of these tasks, you will need to register for an account with Treehouse. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough to finish the required courses), and is $25/month after the trial.

## Objectives
The following are the learning objectives for this prework, all of which are important requirements expected of a professional developer. Though they are not technically “programming” skills, they are crucially important to success both during the class and on the job.

1. Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in writing.
2. Be able to learn in contexts that aren’t necessarily suited to your primary learning style.
3. Adapt to the workflows used by professional developers (using the command line in particular)
4. Be able to develop a very basic, static web site using HTML and CSS.
5. Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one’s own type of mindset.

## Mindset
1. Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
2. Compose an email to Calvin (calvin@theironyard.com) & Nathan (nathan.hall@theironyard.com) answering the following questions:
- Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

## Computer Setup
### Install OSX Yosemite, if you haven’t already
1.  You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
2.  Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
3.  Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.
WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

## HTML/CSS
HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we will only be spending about a week on HTML and CSS, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.

Complete the Code Academy Web course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web, which covers HTML and CSS. This should take you approximately 8-15 hours, depending on your prior experience.

## Javascript
As a front end engineer, javascript is the hammer and nail in your developer toolbelt.  It will allow you to create beautiful things not only on the web, but increasingly everywhere in the programming world. To gain a better understanding of variables, conditionals, and loops, complete the following two courses (roughly 5-15 hours depending on comfort)

1. [Codecademy Web course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) Complete through the "Control Flow" section.

2. [Code School Web course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) Complete through Level 3.

### Supplemental

- [Eloquent Javascript Book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## The Command Line
The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

1. Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
2. Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-t…)
3. Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
4. Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environmen…)
5. Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li…)

## git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable.

Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)

### Supplemental
If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based hosting and communication service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.
3. Email me (calvin@theironyard.com) the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class.

### Supplemental
Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.

# Typing
Believe it or not, *a lot* of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can tryhttp://www.keybr.com/). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io. Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.

# Learn a bit about design

Our class will be focused more on engineering than on design. So, it will be helpful if you already have a pretty good handle on design principles. Here are some helpful resources.

- [An opinionated intro to design](http://uxmyths.com/)
- [Boring, obvious design = good design](http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer)
- [The golden ratio](http://www.joshuagarity.com/web-design/the-golden-ratio/)
- [Font size, line-height, and readability](http://mikeyanderson.com/optimal_characters_per_line)
- [Color theory primer](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437)
- [A medium blog entry on UI techniques](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2-430de537ba96)

# Learning
Finally, if you’re interested in learning how best to study and learn, many of the principles that I use to design our course can be found in the book [Make it Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Make-It-Stick-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013)([public library](http://www.worldcat.org/title/make-it-stick-the-science-of-successful-learning)). It is not required for you to read this book, but it might help.

# Additional Resources
If you finish all of these before the class starts, we have plenty of extra courses to help you continue improving even before class starts. Feel free to reach out to either of us.

Happy coding!  And really looking forward to class!
